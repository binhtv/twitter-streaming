**Spark Streaming Project**

**(See How to build and run in the last page)**

1. **Project idea**

Twitter is known as social network. This project aims to get some insights from twitter feeds for researching purposes

1. **Data set**

Twitter API platform offers options for streaming their real-time Tweets.

1. **Source code and technology**
  1. **Source code**

Unzip the attachment, under root folder you can find commands, HiveQL script and source codes of all applications



You can also get the source code from github.com at [https://github.com/binhtv/twitter-streaming](https://github.com/binhtv/twitter-streaming) for the latest updates

- **--**** Commands detail** (please see how to build and run part)
- **--**** HiveQL script** (please see how to build and run part)
- **--**** tweet folder** (tweet app)

Read real time tweets from twitter by using Twitter4J library

Kafka producer take the tweets to feed into Kafka topic

- **--**** spark\_streaming\_eg folder**: contains source code for streaming jobs

Using KafkaUtils to create a direct stream, subscribe to Kafka topic for getting data from Kafka producter (tweet app)

- **--**** spark\_streaming\_visualization folder**

Contains source code for getting data from Hbase (with Hive table on top) for visualization by using Spark SQL

Then, data is broadcasted to web client app for visualization



- **--**** visualization\_client folder**

Contain source code for running web client app for visualization. This is a simple web application using NodeJs, Pubnub and Highchart

Pubnub subscribe to a channel to get data from this channel

Highchart is javascript library for visualization data with various type of charts and graphs

_Components and flows_

1. **How to build and run**

**Make sure your latest Kafka service installed** , you can download at [https://kafka.apache.org/](https://kafka.apache.org/) and start manually

**You also need to install zookeeper service** , or you can skip this step if you use _zookeeper_ from another service such as HBase or Hadoop

**Make sure Hadoop, Hbase (master &amp; region server), Hive are installed** and working properly in your machine

**Make sure latest NodeJs is installed** on your machine

**Step by step to run:**

1.
  1. In Kafka folder, Start Kafka service

_$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties_

1.
  1. Create a Kafka topic

_$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic sparktest --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --zookeeper localhost:2181_

1.
  1. Copy _hive-site_ configuration file: Make hive and spark can work together

_$ sudo cp /usr/lib/hive/conf/hive-site.xml /usr/lib/spark/conf/_

1.
  1. _At hive shell, create hive tables: tweet\_counts and tweet\_words_

Execute the following scripts in _hive\_tweet.sql_



After running you should see as the following in Hue



From _hbase shell_, you can also see the description of tables by _describe &#39;table\_name&#39;_



1.
  1. At ROOT source code folder, go inside **tweet** folder

$ _mvn clean install_

_$ java -cp target/tweet-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar producer.tweet.App 500 trump,bitcoin,football,snow,rain,soccer,winter,iphone_

1.
  1. At ROOT source code folder, go inside **spark\_streaming\_eg** folder

$ _mvn clean install_

$ _spark-submit --class &quot;c523.spark\_streaming\_eg.SparkStreaming&quot; --master local target/spark\_streaming\_eg-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar localhost:9092 trump,bitcoin,football,snow,iphone_

1.
  1. At ROOT source code folder, go inside **spark\_streaming\_visualization** folder

$ _mvn clean install_

$ _spark-submit --class &quot;c523.spark\_streaming\_eg.SparkSql&quot; --master local target/spark\_streaming\_visualization-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar_

1.
  1. At ROOT source code folder, go inside **visualization\_client** folder

$ node app.js



**        Test your work**

From browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, new IE) go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should see as below:
